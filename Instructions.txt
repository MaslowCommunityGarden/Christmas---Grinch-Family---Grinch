Thank you for downloading Grinch. 
Grinch is set up for 3/4 in depth board and he is 46 inches high. He is also set up for two tool paths. The first is the 
outline that is drawn with the pen holder and sharpie marker, and the second is a 1/4 in router bit. I have included
the drawing in svg format as well as the svg that is loaded into maker cam. I did not include cut file because there are 
two areas that can break off and cause problems if it not watched. They are inside the hand and inside the santa hat.
I brad nailed these two areas. You can also place tabs in these areas as well. Enjoy!
